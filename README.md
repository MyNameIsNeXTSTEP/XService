The alternative solution for processing data at the backend service using the power and decorativeness of XML and XSLT.

1. Create an alternative solution, quite experimental in the beggining, for the backend, and maybe-frontned.
2. Step away from general-purpose or scripting languages in most cases, alowing declarative small scoped transformations to take a place, much like [POP (Pipeline Oriented Programming)](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/pipeline/), https://speakerdeck.com/swlaschin/pipeline-oriented-programming?slide=21
3. Another view and solution of how dataflow, daat-models, transactions works. How to reduce responsible architectural components processing the data.
